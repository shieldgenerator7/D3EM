The "Equestria Mod.txt" file goes in the data/mods/ folder in the main D3 folder, not the mod folder. I imagine everything else goes in the mod folder in a similar file structure as the actual game files.

The "Equestria Mod" folder contained here is the top level folder for the mod

Most of the files contained in here so far were straight up copied from the USA files from the vanilla game, and not much has been changed from it yet.

Also, when I try running this mod, it crashes the game. I don't know why yet, but I'm studying the Russia mod to figure it out (because that one works).

And I don't know how to edit DDS files yet, will have to do more research on it.

Whenever you make a change to the repository, PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT ON WHAT YOU DID. This will help make sure everyone is on the same page with what you did. There's a section in the github shell specifically for that purpose

There is a credits.txt somewhere in here. That's where you put resources you gather from people on the internet (for example, the Equestrian flag picture that I used). You can also put your name there under developers for the mod
